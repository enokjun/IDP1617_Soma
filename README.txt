IDP geotechnical individual report - instructions

Note:
> The soil profile csv files are uploads to show the format of soil parameters and characteristic values are used.
> If you view the code from the github console, please ignore the ^M sign in the code, they irrelevent and would not appear if you view the code after you download the files

To run the matlab for geotechnical design:
1- download both Y1 and Y5 or Z1 and Z5 with the soil profile (AA1 and AA2)
2- open Y1 or Z1 and input the loads, material, architectural constraints and any other construction limits.
3- run the matlab
4- check the folder where matlab codes is and find tabulated results

To run the matlab for structural RC design:
1- download matlab codes with name 'reinforcement' included
2- open the files and input the dimensions, loads, material and architectural constraints.
3- run the matlab
4- follow and type inputs shown in the command window
5- you can save the figures and check the reinforcement details in the command window
